# Predicting-Bike-Rental-Demand
Predicting Bike Rental Demand.

In this notebook, I will use machine learning techniques to predict future bike rental demand based on historical data.

The use of Linear regression, KNN, and Decision Tree models will be explored and analysed. 

The code and analysis is found within the jupyter notebook.
